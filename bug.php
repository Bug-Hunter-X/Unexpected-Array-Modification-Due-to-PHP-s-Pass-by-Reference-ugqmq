This code suffers from a potential issue related to the way PHP handles references.  When passing arrays to functions, PHP passes them by reference by default.  If the function modifies the array, the original array will also be modified. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not aware of this implicit behavior.  Consider the example below:

```php
function modifyArray(array &$arr) {
  $arr[] = 'new element';
}

$myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
modifyArray($myArray);
print_r($myArray); // Output: Array ( [0] => a [1] => b [2] => c [3] => new element )
```

The `modifyArray` function adds a new element to the array, but it directly modifies the original `$myArray` because of the `&` (reference) in the function signature.  This is different from how, say, Java or Python handle array/list arguments.  If you intend for the function to create a copy and avoid modifying the original array, you need to explicitly create a copy before passing it or modify the function signature to not pass by reference.
